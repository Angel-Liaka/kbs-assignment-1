## 👤Student Information
Name: Angel Wesonga<br>

Course:Knowldege Based Sytems

## 🧠 Overview
This project is a demonstration of a simple **Knowledge Based System**.<br>
It involves simple rules, facts and inference details.The language used is Python executed on a Jupyter Notebook.

## 🧩Knowledge Representation

**Facts:**
It is mango season

**Rules:**
IF It is mango season<br> 
THEN Mangoes are readily available

## 🔄 Inference Process
New facts are derived from known rules and facts and are added to the knowledge base.<br>
The fact Mangoes are readily available was inferred by using the rule IF It is mango season,THEN Mangoes are readily available.

## ✅Expected Output
Newly inferred facts: {'Mangoes are readily available'}<br>
All facts in the knowledge base: {'Mangoes are readily available', 'It is mango season'}

## ▶️ How to Run
Open the file  kbs.ipynb on Vscode<br>
Run all cells top to bottom<br>
Check if outputs are correct
